# Fathom

[Fathom](https://usefathom.com) is a simple, privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. To hear the Fathom folks describe it:

> Our entire company is built on putting digital privacy first. We're GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, PECR (and more) compliant. Our business model is selling software, not selling data. Because of this, Fathom doesn't require annoying cookie notices.

## Connecting your Fathom account to Buttondown

<Notice variant="info">
  This guide assumes you're already a paying customer of Fathom!
</Notice>

To wire up your Fathom account to your Buttondown newsletter, all you need to do is create a new site:

  alt="Setting up a new Fathom site."
  width="400"
/>

Once you've done so, you'll receive a new embed code, as seen below:

/>

Go ahead and [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) that "Site ID" (`CPJAXHPW` in the above screenshot) along with your username and I can take care of the rest!
