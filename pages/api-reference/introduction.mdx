# Introduction

Hello and welcome to Buttondown's API schema!

I've designed Buttondown's API to be as RESTful and uninteresting as possible: if there's a primitive in Buttondown, you should have a nice interface for it, with the ability to retrieve, create, modify, and delete. This means that with a few lines in your language of choice, you're able to programmatically keep track of your subscribers, send out new emails, and more.

If you're confused about what Buttondown is, try going to [buttondown.email](https://buttondown.email).

If you're looking for where to find your API Key, check your [Programming page](https://buttondown.email/settings/programming).

export const meta = {
  title: "Introduction to the API reference",
};
export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
