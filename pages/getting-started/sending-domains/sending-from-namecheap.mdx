1. [Log in](https://buttondown.email/login) to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.
2. Your Email address must match your custom sending domain. (If your sending domain is buttondown.xyz, your email has to be name@buttondown.xyz; name@gmail.com won’t work.) Change it if needed.

   4. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In Namecheap, paste it in the "Value" column.  (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)
   5. Click the green checkmark.

8. If it were a pie, you’d wait for it to bake. But it’s computers, so Namecheap can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to go bake a pie.
9. Once your DNS records have finished propagating, click “Check records” in Buttondown. If they all come up with green checkmarks, you’re good to go!
