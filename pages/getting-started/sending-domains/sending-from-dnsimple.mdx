1. [Log in](https://buttondown.email/login) to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.
2. Your Email address must match your custom sending domain. (If your sending domain is fictile.space, your email has to be name@fictile.space; name@gmail.com won’t work.) Change it if needed.

6. Add the TXT record(s) - Follow the steps below for each record that has “TXT” in the “TYPE” column:
   1. Click the blue "Add Record" button.
   2. Choose "TXT" from the drop-down menu.
   3. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".fictile.space" from the "KEY" column.  In DNSimple, paste it in the "Name" column.  (Pink arrow on the left in screenshot below.)
   4. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In DNSimple, paste it in the "Content" column.  (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)
   5. Click the blue "Add Record" button at the bottom of the page.

7. Add the CNAME records - Follow the steps below for each record that has “CNAME” in Buttondown's “TYPE” column:

   1. Click the blue "Add Record" button.
   2. Choose "CNAME" from the drop-down menu.
   4. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".fictile.space" from the "KEY" column.  In DNSimple, paste it in the "Name" column. (Pink arrow on the left in screenshot below.)
   5. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In DNSimple, paste it in the "Content" column.  (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)

8. If it were a pie, you’d wait for it to bake. But it’s computers, so DNSimple can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to go bake a pie.
9. Once your DNS records have finished propagating, click “Check records” in Buttondown. If they all come up with green checkmarks, you’re good to go!




## Troubleshooting


### Did you enter the DNS “KEY” (aka “Host” or “Name”) correctly?

Some registrars want the entire “KEY”, but DNSimple only wants the part before “.fictile.space”. If the “Host”/”Name” field for any of your DNS records in DNSimple ends with “.fictile.space”, remove that part.

### Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'm happy to help!
