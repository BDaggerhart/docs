# Template variables

Template variables are a concept that have multiple names: "mail merges" might be one you're more familiar with if you have a marketing and email background. The concept is
to add snippets in your email that are programmatically replaced when Buttondown sends out an email; this allows you to customize your content per-subscriber or to repeat certain
key concepts in your email without having to change them over and over again.
