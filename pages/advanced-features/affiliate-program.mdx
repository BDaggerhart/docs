# Affiliate program

Buttondown operates purely on word-of-mouth marketing; there are no paid ads or sponsored content or anything like that. Besides the warm feeling in my heart (and most certainly yours), there’s a great reason to spread the good word about Buttondown: the affiliate program!

There’s no user-facing interface to track affiliate conversions or rewards at this point, but it’s something I plan on working on. If you’re interested in being in the beta, [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) to let me know.

Buttondown offers an affiliate program for you to recommend Buttondown to your audience while recurring a recurring **25%** **commission** on all customers you send our way. It's easy to get set up:

1. **Sign up for Buttondown**. Hopefully this one is easy — you should be using Buttondown to promote it, after all! Understanding what Buttondown offers as a tool and how it can help your audience is key.
2. **Share Buttondown with your audience**. Use a `utm_campaign` of your Buttondown username and a `utm_affiliate` of `affiliate`.
3. **Sit back and wait for an email**. I'm manually sending remittances at the moment, so I'll reach out to you once you have payouts ready! (I will automate this at some point, I promise.)
