# Kudos

Buttondown is a labor of love, and I'm deeply indebted to all the folks who have helped along the way: whether its sharing Buttondown (I have no paid marketing, and rely on word of mouth!) or suggesting a feature or supplying a bug report.

(Think your name should be on this list? You're probably right! [Email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'll get it added.)

<Table
  columns={[
    {
      title: "Name",
      key: "name",
      component: ({ url, name }) =>
        url ? (
          <a className="font-bold underline" href={url}>
            {name}
          </a>
        ) : (
          name
        ),
    },
    {
      title: "Reason",
      key: "reason",
    },
  ]}
  content={KUDOS}
/>
