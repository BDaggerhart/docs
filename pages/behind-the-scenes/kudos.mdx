# Kudos

Buttondown is a labor of love, and I'm deeply indebted to all the folks who have helped along the way: whether its sharing Buttondown (I have no paid marketing, and rely on word of mouth!) or suggesting a feature or supplying a bug report.

(Think your name should be on this list? You're probably right! [Email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'll get it added.)
