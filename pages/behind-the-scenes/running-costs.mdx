# Running costs

When I was a younger version of myself, I was always curious about the complex chain of dependencies that even a relatively simple web app requires.

As such, I try and run Buttondown as transparently as possible: I update this page at the start of every month to reflect new expenses and growth. (Unfortunately, Notion doesn't lend itself well to time-series data, so you can't see growth over time.)

My general philosophy on spending money for Buttondown is to default towards it, within reason: Buttondown doesn't have external funding, so I can't exactly _burn_ through my checking account with wild abandon, but it's also not the thing I depend on to make a living, so I can afford to take some liberties.

Anyway, all of that is to say: none of these are probably _that_ surprising, but I hope you find it interesting! Click through each item to read more about how I use it.
